The phrase that defense wins championships is commonly used when regarding most major sporting events. From basketball to football that phrase is tossed around and is often used when predicting a winner. I sought out to answer that question by looking at the past 20 Super Bowl champions. I compared and contrasted the winners and losers to see if the better defense beat the better offense or if the saying defense wins championships is just a saying.
