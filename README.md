**Motivation**

The phrase that defense wins championships is commonly used when regarding most major sporting events. From basketball to football that phrase is tossed around and is often used when predicting a winner. I sought out to answer that question by looking at the past 20 Super Bowl champions. I compared and contrasted the winners and losers to see if the better defense beat the better offense or if the saying defense wins championships is just a saying.

**Data Process**

I first began by trying to find an already created table for the previous Super Bowls' winners and losers with their offensive and defensive rank. However, this became unsuccessful and ultimately I ended up creating my own table from scratch. I created a table with the Super Bowl number, the winning team, their offesnive rank, their defesnive rank, the losing team, their offensive rank, and their defensive rank. This data was easily obtainable for pro football focus and can be viewed as Super Bowl Data. I used this excel sheet to create the histograms that are seen below. I then movidified my table to make all the teams in one column, with their defensive rankings, offesnive rankings, and if they won or lost. This was then used to creat the scatterplot.

**Visualization**

In the first image I created a scatter plot to show the defensive rank and the offensive rank of all the teams. They are colored coded by win or lose.

The following histograms are for the as follows: the defensive rank of the winning team, the offensive rank of the winning team, the defensive rank of the losing team and the offesnive rank of the losing team.

**Analysis**

Using the visualizations above, I first began to look to see if their were any outliers in my study. There only appeared to be two outliers which were the team that had the best defensive but the 25th best ranked offensive that year and the team with the 3rd best offense and the 30th worst defense in the team that year. These outliers were not removed because the other ranking that was not an outlier was normal. Looking at the scatter plot, it appears that their are more green dots towards the bottom of the graph (better defense) and more red dots towards the top. I then created histograms to try and see if their was a pattern of winning teams being towards the top of defense and offense. I found that their were 10 defenses in the top 5 and 12 defenses in the top 10 that won. The winning teams also had strong offenses with 12 teams having a top 10 offense as well with 7 of them being in the top 5. the losing teams only had 10 defenses in the top 10 but had 14 ofeenses ranked in the top 10. Since there was a majority of losing offenses in the 10 but a majority of winning defenses in the top 10 it is safe to say that defense does win championships because more than half of the winning defenses were in the top 10 and more than half of the top losing offenses were in the top 10 as well.
